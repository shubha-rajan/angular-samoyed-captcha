            Can you tell these two apart? The machine learning model we trained with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl">Google Cloud AutoML</a> can!
            Alice and Jamie's entire lives have been documented on camera by their dad, Doug. That's over 10 years worth of data that we were able to use to teach
            our model to tell these two apart! Our model was ultimately able to guess which dog is which with over 80% accuracy. Think you can do better? Try our 
            captcha game below!
